## Overview

The **Custom Vulnerability Scanner** is a Python-based tool designed to scan target IP addresses for open ports and associated services, then cross-reference these services with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to identify known vulnerabilities. This project showcases skills in networking, security, scripting, and API integration.

## Features

- **Network Scanning**: Utilizes `nmap` to discover open ports and services on target systems.
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Integrates with the NVD API to fetch and display relevant CVEs for identified services.
- **Report Generation**: Outputs scan results and vulnerabilities in a readable format.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new features like GUI, multi-threading, or advanced reporting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and above.
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **nmap**: Ensure `nmap` is installed on your system.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/custom-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd custom-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. **Install Python Dependencies**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install nmap**

   - **Ubuntu/Debian**

     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nmap
     ```

   - **macOS** (using Homebrew)

     ```bash
     brew install nmap
     ```

   - **Windows**

     Download and install from the [official nmap website](https://nmap.org/download.html).

## Usage

1. **Basic Scan**

   ```bash
   python vuln_scanner.py --target <TARGET_IP>
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   python vuln_scanner.py --target 192.168.1.1
   ```

2. **Scan Multiple Targets**

   You can provide multiple IPs or a range.

   ```bash
   python vuln_scanner.py --target 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.3
   ```

3. **Specify Port Range**

   ```bash
   python vuln_scanner.py --target 192.168.1.1 --ports 1-65535
   ```

4. **Output to File**

   ```bash
   python vuln_scanner.py --target 192.168.1.1 --output report.txt
   ```

## Configuration

The script can be customized using command-line arguments:

- `--target`: Specify target IP(s) to scan.
- `--ports`: Define port range (default: `1-1024`).
- `--output`: Save the scan results to a file.
- `--cve-results`: Number of CVE results to fetch per service (default: `10`).

**Example:**

```bash
python vuln_scanner.py --target 192.168.1.1 --ports 80,443 --cve-results 5
```

## Dependencies

- **Python Libraries:**
  - `python-nmap`: Interface with nmap.
  - `requests`: Make HTTP requests to the NVD API.
  
- **System Tools:**
  - `nmap`: Network scanning tool.

**Install Python dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt` Content:**

```plaintext
python-nmap
requests
```
